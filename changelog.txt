Version: 0.2.0
Date: 2026-01-10
  Major Features:
    - the alternative selection option (shift + left click) now removes only corpses.
  Minor Features:
    - items dropped by corpses upon removal can now be picked up by walking over them, and they
      won't be moved by any existing conveyor belts.
  Changes:
    - now raises an event when corpses with an inventory are destroyed, just in case other mods
      need to know.
    - compacted code, tidied up formatting, simplified mod structure.
    - removed storage table, caching of settings with it not really needed.
  Bugfixes:
    - fixed issue with corpses not dropping any items on the ground when removed, even when the
      setting for it is enabled (still not made to work on character corpses).
