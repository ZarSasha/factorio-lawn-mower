Version: 0.2.0
Date: 2026-01-11
  Major Features:
    - the alternative selection option (shift + left click by default) now clears only corpses.
  Minor Features:
    - items dropped from cleared corpses can now be picked up by walking over them, and they won't
      be moved by any existing conveyor belts.
  Changes:
    - now raises an event when minable corpses are cleared, just in case other mods need to know.
    - compacted code, tidied up formatting, simplified mod structure.
  Bugfixes:
    - fixed issue with corpses not dropping any items on the ground when cleared, even when the
      setting for it is enabled (won't work on character corpses, btw).
